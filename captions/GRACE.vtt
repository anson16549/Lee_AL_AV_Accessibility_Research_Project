00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:14.690
Detective Superintendent Grace, you are in
the dark arts, but never lies.

2
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.530
I don't get it. What do you see in him?

3
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410
I don't care for anything.

4
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.240
You can't put next to a tick box.

5
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.910
And met Sandy in Brighton.

6
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.410
We fell in love here. We got married here.

7
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.380
I lost her here. People don't just
disappear.

8
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.620
They all mean something to somebody.

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.100
Was Michael fathers, sons, mothers,
daughters?

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.680
I thought this was about preservation of
life.

11
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.800
What do you think does not matter anymore.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.960
This was never your case.

13
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.600
I'll find out. No, you won't.

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.370
You're done.

15
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.960
He didn't know. It's my job to know.
