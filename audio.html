                [Verse 1]
                Hold me close 'til I get up
                Time is barely on our side
                I don't wanna waste what's left
                The storms we chase are leadin' us
                And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
                No, I don't wanna waste what's left<br><br>

                [Chorus]
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                And on and on we'll go
                On we'll go<br><br>

                [Verse 2]
                Finding life along the way
                Melodies we haven't played
                No, I don't want no rest
                Echoin' around these walls
                Fighting to create a song (yeah)
                I don't wanna miss a beat<br><br>

                [Chorus]
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                And on and on we'll go<br><br>

                [Bridge]
                And we'll grow in number
                Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon
                Turn us to thousands
                And we'll grow in number
                Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon
                Turn us to thousands<br><br>

                [Chorus]
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
                And on and on we'll go
                Through the wastelands, through the highways
                And on and on we'll go
